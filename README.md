# PRODIGY_CS_05
For my final task during my cybersecurity internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I created a packet-sniffing tool using Python's scapy library. It captures TCP packets by default, saving details to packet_sniffer_results.txt. The tool can be adjusted to capture all packets or run indefinitely. Tested on Kali Linux, it requires superuser privileges.
